# Regression-Analysis-of-Diamond-Prices

## An exploratory analysis of diamond prices using linear regression - creating predictions, running diagnostic checks for model assumptions, transforming variables when necessary, checking model fit and multicollinearity with R-squared and VIF (variance inflation factor)

This report sought to fit a linear regression model in R for diamond price, choosing the most relevant predictors out of 4 chosen to do this, carat, color, clarity, and depth. The final model was chosen after running diagnostic checking on the model's assumptions, transforming predictors and the response, checking model fit with adjusted $R^{2}$ values, using criterion based variable selection methods like stepwise AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), analyzing multicollinearity with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) and leverage and influential points using Cook's distance. Additionally, EDA was run, and R outputs were thoroughly interpretted like the linear regression `summary()` function output for instance. The data was taken from the “Diamonds Prices” dataset on Kaggle, randomly sampling 1000 observations.
